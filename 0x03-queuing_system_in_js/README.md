# The ALX Project: Queuing System in JS
-------------
The `Queuing System in JS` is designed to __manage and organize a queue of tasks or jobs__. 
It is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be processed in a sequential order 
or based on certain priorities. 
The system includes features such as __adding tasks to the queue__, __removing tasks__, 
and __processing tasks__ in a __synchronous__ or __asynchronous manner__.

For instance:

   |                     |
   |   +-------------+   |
   |   |    Queue    |   |
   |   +------+------|   |
   |          |      |   |
   |          v      |   |
   |   +-------------+   |
   |   |  Task 1     |   |
   |   |  Task 2     |   |
   |   |  ...        |   |
   |   +-------------+   |
   |          |          |
   |          |          |
   |          v          |
   |   +-------------+   |
   |   |  Processor  |   |
   |   +------+------|   |
   |          |      |   |
   |          v      |   |
   |   +-------------+   |
   |   |  Process    |   |
   |   |  Tasks      |   |
   |   |  ...        |   |
