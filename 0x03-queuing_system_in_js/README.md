# The ALX Project: Queuing System in JS
----------------
The `Queuing System in JS` is designed to manage and organize a queue of tasks or jobs. 
It is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be processed in __a sequential order__ 
or based on certain priorities. The system includes features such as __adding tasks to the queue__, 
__removing tasks__, and __processing tasks__ in a __synchronous__ or __asynchronous manner.__
